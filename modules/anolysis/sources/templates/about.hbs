      A brief introduction into our privacy-preserving collection framework
      for usage data.

  <div class="card-body">
      Anolysis is a new approach for collecting usage data
      without relying on user profiles. The approach is inspired
      by the principle of group anonymity; making sure that <code>K</code> users 
      are indistinguishable from each other. Users send sanitized browser 
      attributes in the form of a group identity, and usage data through 
      multiple messages, in a way that this data cannot be pieced together and 
      used as an identifier.

      <br /><br />
      
      We are able to achieve privacy by design, by representing browser 
      attributes hierarchically in a tree structure and algorithmically creating 
      anonymous groups that guarantee a minimum size of 100.

      <br /><br />

      So here's what you can take away from this:
      <ul>
        <li>
          You get a group ID, shared by at least 100 other users having similar 
          browser attributes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cliqz is never able to link back to you the messages sent from your 
          browser (explicitly or implicitly).
        </li>
        <li>
          Some messages do not even send your group ID.
        </li>
      </ul>
